1. Please download all the files from the this repository in one local folder, and designate the same folder as the current working directory. 

2. Running the file 'Main_Figure.R' independently returns:  1), all the figure plots (Figure 2 and 3) in the manuscript, and 2), data source including raw data, basic statistics (e.g., grand-mean), and modeling fittings. 

(tips: Please collapse all the chunks (separate with ----#) for a clearer structure.)

3. The whole procedure of the model fitting can be found in 'Bayesian_model_final.R', which can also be run independently.
